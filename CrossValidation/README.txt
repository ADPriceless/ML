File: ExamPerformanceCrossVal.py
This file is to practice cross-validation. The data is split into 5 equally-sized folds, from from which one is selected as the test fold while the others are combined to make the training set. Each classifier is then trained and tested on each test fold (with the other four making up the training set).The classifier with the best average score from all test folds is selected.
